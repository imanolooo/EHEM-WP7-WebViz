# STEPS:

- Navigation inside the models -> indoors and cesium is thougt for outdoors => CYENS
	- first-person navigation improved
	- teleport-to targets => Suggested to CYENS
	- MAP: navigation architectural map
		- teleport to targets
		- teleport to architectural spaces
		- history of the visited places -> help the user during the navigation
	- STORY: navigation art historian landmark map => ordered set of landmarks
		- we can use the cesium ones => STORY MODE
		- teleport to pov
		- history of the visited places -> help the user during the navigation
	- CHANGE MODELS: navigation intramodel
		- changing the displayed model
- Define volume (architectural phases) and keypoint (poi/landmarks)
	- Better, define points inside the volume to know where the user is.
- Create all the needed menus
- Connection to DB -> XML file (obtained from filemaker)
	- read and parse the XML file
	- showing the graphic materials => UPC
		- all the available
		- all the related to an specific architectural space
			- JS need to detect in which architectural space is the user at anytime
	- showing the descriptions
		- monument level
		* architectural phase level
		* architectural space level
	* showing the annotation => UPC
* Decide license!
* How we will manage the front-end+style? -> React?

#  How to collaborate
- using github
	- create branch for each task => ONLY WORRIED ON MERGES
	- Created a shared folder in EHEM-WP7 repo to share documents.
	- EMAIL as communication

# Possible different applications
* General public -> No access to DB or limited access to DB
* Restorers / Art historians -> Full access to DB
