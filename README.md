Template Cesium Viewer implemented in Next.js 14.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To begin with, go to the `nextjs-cesium-viewer` directory and follow the steps mentioned below.

## Getting Started

First, install the required packages:

```bash
# By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json
npm install 
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The Map component of the viewer can be modified on `components/map.tsx`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
